# Features

Paper has a number of useful features that make it a developer friendly theme to work with out of the box.

- **Fast and reliable**: From the very beginning, we've made sure Paper works fast and reliably by using the latest browser-supported features. Don't worry if you're still using an older browser, our progressive enhancement ensures you'll still have the best experience.
- **Works with JavaScript disabled**: We want everyone to have access to your store, so we've minimized the use of JavaScript. Even if someone has disabled JavaScript, we've got you covered with excellent fallbacks for core functionality.
- **Easily extendable**: We've built Paper with a modular approach, so it's super simple to extend and customize. We use Tailwind CSS to give you an easy approach to styling, and Alpine.js to add interactivity without weighing you down.
- **Meets all standards for theme store**: Paper meets all the [requirements](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/store/requirements) for the Shopify theme store.

# Making changes

### Development previews

Use `npm run dev` to setup a development preview that refreshes your CSS and JavaScript as you make changes. This is the best way to implement more in-depth changes on Paper. You should also consider implementing the [GitHub integration](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/github) into your workflow.

### Naming coventions

Paper uses a naming convention to help keep things organized. We use the following prefixes to help identify the files in our `/snippet` folder.

- `components__`: Components are reusable pieces of code that can be used in multiple places. Most of our components are used in multiple places throughout the theme.
- `theme__`: Theme files are only ever used in the `theme.liquid` file. These are global snippets that appear on every page of your theme.
- `script__`: Script files contain small snippets of JavaScript that are used throughout the theme.
- `article__`, `collection__`, `product__`: Article, collection and product files are used in their respecitive templates only.
- `header__`: Header files are used to within the header of your theme.

Section files follow a similar naming convention.

- Section files prefixed with a keyword and a double underscore are only used in their respecitve template files. E.g. `collection__banner.liquid` is only used in the `collection.liquid` file.

### Tips and tricks

- Use the `theme__styles.liquid` file to update or edit theme-wide CSS variables.

### Using Alpine.js

- For debugging there are [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/alpinejs-devtools/fopaemeedckajflibkpifppcankfmbhk) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/alpinejs-devtools/?src=recommended) browser extensions available.
